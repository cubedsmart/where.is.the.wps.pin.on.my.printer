The WPS pin can almost always be found in the settings menu of your printer’s control panel. It will vary brand by brand, but you simply need to enter the settings menu, and look for wifi or network options and the WPS pin should be in one of the nested menus. You can always refer to the printer’s user guide and look for the WPS pin in the index or table of contents, but if you just scroll through the printer’s settings menu, you will undoubtedly come across the WPS pin setting. Selecting that from the menu should show you the 8 digit WPS pin for your printer.
